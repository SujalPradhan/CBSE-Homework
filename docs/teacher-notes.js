  river: {
    prep: 'None. Online only.',
    answers: 'The 10 km step gives the shortest length. Each smaller step gives a longer one, but the gain gets smaller (the 1 km figure is only a little above the 2 km one). The closest measurement is the 2 km step.',
    rubric: [
      ['Got it', 'The three lengths are read correctly, the 1 km prediction is slightly above the 2 km one, and the sentence says small steps follow the bends.'],
      ['Partly', 'Numbers are right but the sentence is only “it is more accurate”.'],
      ['Not yet', 'Lengths do not match the map, or the prediction is shorter than the 2 km length.'],
    ],
    misconceptions: ['A longer step is more accurate.', 'The river has one fixed length whatever you use.'],
    classCheck: ['A road is measured with a 100 m step and then a 10 m step. Which length is bigger, and why?'],
  },
  fence: {
    prep: 'None. Online only.',
    answers: 'Any rectangle with length + breadth = half the fence works. A different rectangle can have a bigger area. The biggest whole-number field is as close to a square as whole numbers allow (for 30 m, 7 m by 8 m). Squarer shapes hold more area.',
    rubric: [
      ['Got it', 'All fields use the fence exactly, the second is bigger than the first, the biggest is the square, and the sentence says the same fence can split into different shapes.'],
      ['Partly', 'Fields are right but the biggest is not the square, or the sentence only says “it depends”.'],
      ['Not yet', 'Fields do not use the whole fence.'],
    ],
    misconceptions: ['The same perimeter means the same area.', 'A long thin field is the biggest.'],
    classCheck: ['Two fields each have 20 m of fence. One is 9 m by 1 m. Which has more area, and by how much, if the other is 5 m by 5 m?'],
  },
  pendulum: {
    prep: 'None. Online only.',
    answers: 'Each student has a different “planet”, so times differ. In every case 100 cm takes about 2 times as long as 25 cm. The time at the new length is about √(length ÷ 25) times the 25 cm time. {{k}}× the time needs 25 × k² cm. Mass does not change the time.',
    rubric: [
      ['Got it', 'The two times are read correctly, the ratio is about 2, the predictions follow from it, mass is ruled out, and the sentence says longer is slower but not in step with the length.'],
      ['Partly', 'Numbers are right but the sentence is only “longer thread, longer time”.'],
      ['Not yet', 'Times are not from the lab, or the ratio is taken as 4.'],
    ],
    misconceptions: ['Four times the length gives four times the time.', 'A heavier bob swings faster.'],
    classCheck: ['A pendulum takes 6 s for 10 swings at 25 cm. About how long at 100 cm?'],
  },
  dissolve: {
    prep: 'None. Online only.',
    answers: 'Hot water dissolves more spoons than cold. A full glass takes twice as many as a half glass. Stirring changes how fast it dissolves, not how much. Each student’s salt is different, so numbers differ.',
    rubric: [
      ['Got it', 'The two readings are correct, the extra spoons match, the full-glass and glasses answers follow, stirring is “the same”, and the sentence says the water is full.'],
      ['Partly', 'Numbers are right but the sentence is “it just does not dissolve”.'],
      ['Not yet', 'Readings are not from the lab, or stirring is said to add salt.'],
    ],
    misconceptions: ['Stirring lets more salt dissolve.', 'Salt that has gone is destroyed.'],
    classCheck: ['A glass takes 6 spoons at 20 °C and 9 at 60 °C. How many spoons for two glasses at 60 °C?'],
  },
  mixer: {
    prep: 'None. Online only.',
    answers: 'Same taste means the same sugar for each cup. Multiply the cups by that number. A drink with a different spoons-to-cups ratio is sweeter or less sweet. Spoons ÷ (spoons per cup) gives the cups.',
    rubric: [
      ['Got it', 'Both sugar amounts follow the ratio, the new drink is judged correctly, the cups answer is right, and the sentence uses sugar per cup.'],
      ['Partly', 'Answers are right but the method is “I tried until it matched”.'],
      ['Not yet', 'Sugar is added by the same number of spoons, not the same factor.'],
    ],
    misconceptions: ['Adding the same number of spoons keeps the taste.', 'Doubling water needs the sugar to stay the same.'],
