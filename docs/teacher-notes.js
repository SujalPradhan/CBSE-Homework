  handspan: {
    prep: 'None.',
    answers: 'Adult handspans (18–23 cm) are bigger than a child’s (14–19 cm), so the adult needs fewer. Count × handspan matches the ruler within about 10%. The bench answer is the bench length ÷ the adult’s handspan. The fair measure is the metre scale.',
    rubric: [
      ['Got it', 'Numbers agree, the bench answer uses the adult’s handspan, and the sentence says hands differ so we need a standard unit.'],
      ['Partly', 'Numbers agree but the reason is only “hands are different”.'],
      ['Not yet', 'Counts do not match the length, or the bench answer ignores the adult’s handspan.'],
    ],
    misconceptions: ['A bigger hand gives a bigger count.', 'The ruler is “just another way”.'],
    classCheck: ['Riya’s handspan is 15 cm and her father’s is 20 cm. A bench is 12 of Riya’s handspans. How many of her father’s?'],
  },
  pendulum: {
    prep: 'None.',
    answers: 'A 25 cm pendulum takes about 10 s for 10 swings, 36 cm about 12 s, 49 cm about 14 s. 4× the length gives about 2× the time. Time at 1.5× length is about 1.22× the first time. A second stone changes almost nothing.',
    rubric: [
      ['Got it', 'Times are steady, 4× length gives about 2× time, the prediction and the length for the goal time follow from their own data, and mass does not matter.'],
      ['Partly', 'Longer means slower, but the time is expected to grow as much as the length.'],
      ['Not yet', 'Times look like half-swings or random, or the length is said to make it faster.'],
    ],
    misconceptions: ['4× the length gives 4× the time.', 'A heavier stone swings faster.', 'One side to the other is a whole swing.'],
    classCheck: ['A pendulum takes 15 s for 10 swings. How long is one swing?', 'Two pendulums, same length, one stone heavier. Which swings faster?'],
  },
  salt: {
    prep: 'None.',
    answers: 'Half a glass dissolves about 5–8 level teaspoons; a full glass about twice as many. Claim 1 can’t be tested here. Claims 2 and 3 disagree with what you see (it stops dissolving; the water tastes salty). Claim 4 can’t be tested here because the temperature did not change (salt barely changes with temperature; sugar does).',
    rubric: [
      ['Got it', 'Full glass takes about twice the spoons; claims sorted correctly; the sentence says the salt is still there as solid because the water is full.'],
      ['Partly', 'Counts make sense, but claims are mixed up or the sentence says only that it “did not dissolve”.'],
      ['Not yet', 'Says the salt vanished, or any amount dissolves.'],
    ],
    misconceptions: ['Dissolved means gone.', 'Stirring longer dissolves any amount.', 'One experiment can test every claim.'],
    classCheck: ['Which is saltier: 2 spoons in 100 mL or 4 spoons in 50 mL?'],
  },
  paper: {
    prep: 'None. A notebook with 120+ pages works best.',
    answers: 'Notebook paper is about 0.07–0.12 mm per sheet. A stack of N pages has N ÷ 2 sheets. 80 pages ≈ 40 sheets ≈ 3–5 mm. The pile answer is thickness × sheets. Measuring 100 sheets is best because the 0.5 mm ruler error is shared among more sheets.',
    rubric: [
      ['Got it', 'Divides by sheets (pages ÷ 2), writes thousandths correctly, scales the pile, and says a big stack shrinks the ruler error.'],
      ['Partly', 'Correct arithmetic but divides by pages, or no reason for the stack.'],
      ['Not yet', 'Decimal place errors (0.85 for 0.085) or no link to the stack.'],
    ],
    misconceptions: ['Pages and sheets are the same.', '0.85 is smaller than 0.085.', 'Measuring one sheet carefully is just as good.'],
    classCheck: ['50 sheets make a stack 4.5 mm tall. How thick is one sheet?'],
  },
  sweet: {
    prep: 'None. Remind students to ask before using sugar.',
    answers: 'B has twice the spoons of A. A and B taste the same; C (one more spoon for double the water) tastes less sweet. Cups from J spoons = J ÷ spoons in A. C needs (A − 1) more spoons: 2A − (A + 1).',
    rubric: [
      ['Got it', 'B = 2 × A, C picked as least sweet, correct cups and fix, and the sentence says the sugar must double when the water doubles.'],
      ['Partly', 'B is correct but the fix or the reason is shaky.'],
      ['Not yet', 'Adds instead of multiplies (B = A + 1).'],
    ],
    misconceptions: ['Adding the same amount keeps the ratio.', 'Ratio answers must be whole numbers.'],
    classCheck: ['Kesang made 6 glasses with 10 spoons. How many spoons for 24 glasses?'],
