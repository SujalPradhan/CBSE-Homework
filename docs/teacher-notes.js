  handspan: {
    prep: 'None. Students need a ruler or tape at home.',
    answers: 'Handspans for 11–13-year-olds are usually 14–19 cm; adults 18–23 cm. The adult needs fewer handspans. Count × handspan should be within about 15% of the ruler length, for both people. The gap comes from hands not placed exactly end to end and rounding to halves.',
    rubric: [
      ['Got it', 'Says the bigger hand gives the smaller count AND that a standard unit (cm) gives everyone the same number. Uses their own numbers.'],
      ['Partly', 'Notices the counts differ but explains it only as "hands are different" without linking size to count.'],
      ['Not yet', 'Thinks the counts should be the same, or numbers do not agree (count × handspan far from the table length).'],
    ],
    misconceptions: ['A bigger hand gives a bigger number.', 'The ruler measurement is "just another way", not more reliable.', 'Fractions of a handspan do not count.'],
    classCheck: ['Riya’s handspan is 15 cm. Her father’s is 20 cm. A bench is 12 of Riya’s handspans. How many of her father’s handspans is it?', 'Right now, everyone measure your desk in handspans. Why are our numbers different?'],
    ai: 'An AI can write the explanation and invent numbers. It cannot know the length of THIS student’s table or what their family member said. The class check uses a fresh case.',
    collab: 'In class, list everyone’s handspan on the board. The spread shows why standard units are needed.',
  },
  pendulum: {
    prep: 'None. Students need thread, a small weight and a watch.',
    answers: '25 cm: about 10 s for 10 oscillations (1.0 s each). 100 cm: about 20 s (2.0 s each). So 4× the length gives 2× the time, not 4×. A heavier bob makes almost no difference. A slow clock needs a shorter pendulum. Real hand timings vary by a few tenths of a second between tries; identical tries are a reason to ask questions.',
    rubric: [
      ['Got it', 'Longer → slower, with their own two tries per length; says 4× length gave about 2× time; mass does not matter; correct clock answer; describes a real timing difficulty.'],
      ['Partly', 'Longer → slower, but says time grows in the same proportion as length, or gives no numbers.'],
      ['Not yet', 'Says longer swings faster, or that the heavier bob changes the time, or numbers suggest counting half-swings.'],
    ],
    misconceptions: ['A heavier bob swings faster.', 'Doubling the length doubles the time.', 'One swing to one side is one oscillation.'],
    classCheck: ['A pendulum takes 15 s for 10 oscillations. What is its time period?', 'Two pendulums have the same length; one bob is heavier. Which swings faster?'],
    ai: 'An AI knows the formula and can invent realistic times. It cannot hang the thread. The clock question and the in-class check test whether the idea stuck.',
    collab: 'Students with different lengths pool their results in class: plot length vs time on the board and see the curve.',
  },
  salt: {
    prep: 'None. Salt and a glass at home.',
    answers: 'Half a glass (~100 mL) dissolves roughly 5–8 level teaspoons of salt, depending on spoon size. Sentence 1 is right. Sentences 2 and 3 are wrong and the experiment shows it (it stops dissolving; the water tastes salty). Sentence 4 is wrong in general (sugar and baking soda dissolve much more in hot water; Activity 9.2 is a teacher demonstration) but this experiment does not change temperature, so it cannot test it. Note for teachers: common salt itself barely changes with temperature (about 36 g per 100 mL at 20 °C, 39 g at 100 °C), so a hot-water test should use sugar, with an adult handling hot water. Adding 2 spoons of water makes some of the leftover salt dissolve.',
    rubric: [
      ['Got it', 'Ticks 2 and 3 with evidence (stopped dissolving; tasted salty; more water dissolved more salt). Says sentence 4 needs a different experiment and describes one. Uses "saturated".'],
      ['Partly', 'Finds one wrong sentence with evidence, or ticks 4 without saying it was not tested.'],
      ['Not yet', 'Agrees the salt is "gone", or ticks sentence 1 as wrong.'],
    ],
    misconceptions: ['Dissolved means disappeared.', 'Stirring longer lets water dissolve any amount.', 'Every claim can be checked with one experiment.'],
    classCheck: ['Which is more concentrated: 2 spoons of salt in 100 mL of water, or 4 spoons in 50 mL? (from the textbook)', 'Your friend says an AI told them sugar does not dissolve in hot water. How would you check?'],
    ai: 'Students may paste the AI text into another AI. It will likely spot sentences 2–4 as wrong. It cannot report the spoon count or the taste, and noticing that sentence 4 was NOT tested by this experiment is the key reasoning step.',
    collab: 'Compare spoon counts in class: why do they differ (spoon size, water amount)? This leads to why scientists use grams and millilitres.',
  },
  paper: {
    prep: 'None.',
    answers: 'Notebook and textbook paper is usually 0.07–0.12 mm per sheet. 50 sheets ≈ 4–6 mm; 100 sheets ≈ 8–12 mm. The bigger stack is better because the ruler error (±0.5 mm) is shared among more sheets. The two answers differ because of ruler error and how tightly each stack was squeezed. A 300-page book has 150 sheets.',
    rubric: [
      ['Got it', 'Correct divisions to thousandths; says the bigger stack is better because the same ruler error is spread over more sheets; book check uses sheets = pages ÷ 2.'],
      ['Partly', 'Correct divisions but vague about why the bigger stack is better, or forgets pages ÷ 2 in the book check.'],
      ['Not yet', 'Division or decimal place errors (e.g. 0.85 instead of 0.085), or counts pages as sheets.'],
    ],
    misconceptions: ['0.085 is bigger than 0.1 because 85 > 1.', 'Pages and sheets are the same.', 'Measuring one sheet "carefully" is as good as measuring a stack.'],
    classCheck: ['50 sheets make a stack 4.5 mm high. How thick is one sheet?', 'A book is 18 mm thick without covers. Its sheets are 0.09 mm. How many pages does it have?'],
    ai: 'An AI can do the divisions and the reasoning. It cannot measure the student’s notebook or book. Faking still means dividing decimals to thousandths, which is the skill.',
    collab: 'Students with different paper (notebook, textbook, newspaper) compare: same method, different answers. Which paper is thickest?',
  },
  sweet: {
    prep: 'None. Remind students to ask before using sugar.',
    answers: 'B = 2 × A spoons (1 : a :: 2 : 2a). A and B should taste the same; C is less sweet (half the sugar per cup). Drink D: spoons = a × cups. With 5 spoons: 5 ÷ a cups (2½ cups if a = 2).',
    rubric: [
      ['Got it', 'Correct B, D and challenge; shows A and B are in the same ratio; explains C has half the sugar per cup; reports the taster’s own words.'],
      ['Partly', 'Correct B but stuck on the 5-spoon challenge (non-whole answer), or explains C only by taste without ratios.'],
      ['Not yet', 'Adds instead of multiplies (e.g. B = a + 1), or thinks C should taste the same.'],
    ],
    misconceptions: ['Adding the same amount keeps a ratio the same.', 'Answers to ratio problems must be whole numbers.', 'Same sugar means same sweetness.'],
    classCheck: ['Kesang made 6 glasses with 10 spoons. How many spoons for 24 glasses?', 'A recipe uses 3 cups of rice to 5 cups of water. You have 4 cups of rice. How much water?'],
    ai: 'An AI can do the proportion. It cannot do the taste test or know which cups the family member picked. The surprising result (C tastes weaker) is the memorable part.',
    collab: 'Pairs can each make a different recipe A and swap: can your partner scale YOUR recipe?',
  },
